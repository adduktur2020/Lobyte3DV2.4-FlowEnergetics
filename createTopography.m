% Create initial topography, with a basin margin slope down to a flat or very gently inclined basin floor
% Basin margin ranges from maxElev, which is taken as the relief of the slope above the basin floor, to the basin floor at elevation 0m
% Note that all elevations are assumed in this case to be below sea-level, representing a marine basin slope and basin floor

    slopeDecayRate = maxElev * 0.02; % Specify the slope gradient, as 2% of the maxElev per grid cell
    basinFloorSlope = 0.00; % Specify the basin-floor gradient, per grid cell, in meters. Zero for these model runs

    % Now to make sure the floor is never completely flat, which would be unrealistic and may cause artifacts in the flow calculations, add some
    % low amplitude random noise to that topography
    noise = rand(glob.ySize,glob.xSize).*0.0006;
    topog = topog + noise;

    % Finally, make sure that the lowest topography value on the grid is zero, not a minus number,
    % to avoid issues with complex number results in flow algorithms
    minTopogValue = min(min(topog));
    topog = topog + abs(minTopogValue); % So find minimum value in the topography and add it backt to the topography to ensure min=zero
